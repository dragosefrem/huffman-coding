# huffman-coding
C program (Windows only) that allows for encoding/decoding of binary files into and from the Huffman coding algorithm. Small project made for the Design and analysis of algorithms (RO) lab during my second year of Computer Engineering studies at Polytechnic University of Timi»ôoara.
## Running the program (Windows)

The program can only be run via the command line.

To run the program, simply choose from the following two actions:
 - encode a binary file on your system using the Huffman compression format
 - decode a file on your system that has already been encrypted by my program

For instance, supposing you have a file test.txt on your system, located in the same folder you have the executable on, then to encode/compress the file the following command can be executed:
```bash
  huff enc test.txt
```

After this, a new file will be generated, having the same name as the one given as second parameter to the program but with "_encoded" appended to it and with the extension .EfremHuffmanCompression. In this case, it's going to be test_encoded.EfremHuffmanCompression. To decode this file, the following command can be executed:
```bash
  huff dec test.EfremHuffmanCompression
```
Thus, the file generated will have the same name as the file you are trying to decrypt, but with "_encoded" appended to it. To view the decrypted file, simply access test_encoded_decoded.txt on your system. The file should have the same content as the text.txt file given in the first step.
## Features

- Able to compress any type of binary file (image files, audio files, text files etc).
- Supports any file size.
- Fast and reliable compression and decompression.

*Note: It's possible not all binary files will compress to a smaller size. This is due to the uniformity of binary data being read and the probability of not existing patterns strong enough so that data is replaced with smaller data. For example, text files contain patterns, have many repeating symbols and the human language uses a limited set of characters, which means text files have a great ratio of being compressed to much smaller sizes then, let's say, image files, where data is much more arbitrary.*
